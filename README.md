## Data Engineering Zoomcamp - Week 3

In week 3 of Data Learning, We learned a lot of things and I want to explain about that 

## OLAP vs OLTP
In data engineering, there are two major concepts: Online analytical processing (OLAP) and Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), which serve different purposes in an organization. The table below summarises the difference between these two concept relatively well.

In short, OLTP List day-to-day business transactions but OLAP for multi-dimension view of enterprise data

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-zoomcamp.git mage-zoomcamp
```

Navigate to the repo:

```bash
cd mage-data-engineering-zoomcamp
```

Rename `dev.env` to simply `.env`— this will _ensure_ the file is not committed to Git by accident, since it _will_ contain credentials in the future.

Now, let's build the container

```bash
docker compose build
```

Finally, start the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Now, navigate to http://localhost:6789 in your browser! Voila! You're ready to get started with the course. 

### What just happened?

We just initialized a new mage repository. It will be present in your project under the name `magic-zoomcamp`. If you changed the varable `PROJECT_NAME` in the `.env` file, it will be named whatever you set it to.

This repository should have the following structure:

```
.
├── mage_data
│   └── magic-zoomcamp
├── magic-zoomcamp
│   ├── __pycache__
